Moosy Research is recognized for it's high quality cryptocurrency sheets, [Cointrexer, BotMon and ReX](https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/cryptos).

Most cryptocurrency Exchanges provide powerful API consisting of REST endpoints for transactional operations.
In order to authenticate to an Exchange API requires a valid API Key and a secret are required to access the private endpoints.

Many APIs require a signature during authentication that is calculated based on an algorithm like SHA.
On this page, you find a collection of Google App Script (GAS) functions for Signed / Private Requests to several exchanges.

These sample code snippets authenticate to the API and will list your balance in the built-in Logger.

Please **â˜… Star** on the top of this page if you like this page and you want to motivate me to publish more.

To explore some of these APIs from Google Script, you can try [ReX](https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/cryptos/doc/rex). It's an interactive API explorer in Sheets that allows you to see the request and the response data. **ReX** is great for **educational purposes**; the script log will show details on complete HTTP/REST request and response.
