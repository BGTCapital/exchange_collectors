Moosy Research is the home of cryptocurrency sheet, like [Cointrexer, CtrXL and BotMon](https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/cryptos).

Most cryptocurrency Exchanges provide powerful API consisting of REST endpoints for transactional operations.
In order to authenticate to an Exchange API requires a valid API Key and a secret are required to access the private endpoints.

Many APIs require a signature during authentication that is calculated based on an algorithm like SHA.
This is a collection of Google App Script (GAS) functions for Signed / Private Requests to request a balance.

These sample code snippets authenticate to the API and will list your balance.
