Moosy Research is recognized for it's high quality cryptocurrency sheets, [Cointrexer and BotMon](https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/cryptos).

Most cryptocurrency Exchanges provide powerful API consisting of REST endpoints for transactional operations.
In order to authenticate to an Exchange API requires a valid API Key and a secret are required to access the private endpoints.

Many APIs require a signature during authentication that is calculated based on an algorithm like SHA.
On this pageyou find a collection of Google App Script (GAS) functions for Signed / Private Requests to several exchanges.

These sample code snippets authenticate to the API and will list your balance in the built-in Logger.

Please **â˜… Star** on the top of this page if you like this page and you want to motivate me to publish more.
